Problem 1
1. The goal of their simulation study is to demonstrate the 
likelihood ratio statistic is converge to a weighted sum of 
independent chi-square distribution. They test the number of 
their components in a normal mixture distribution (a single 
normal versus a two component mixture versus three-component 
mixture normal distribution). The metrics they consider in 
assessing their methods is using EM algorithm with 100 sets 
in MLE and also are listed as (8)-(12) in the article.

2. The choices the authors must make in designing their simulation
 study are determine an appropriate sample size and nominal value, 
the null hypothesis and assumption, and the mixing proportion. The
 key aspects of the data generating mechanism that likely affect 
the statistical power of test are how well the sample was generated
 from the distribution and if the sample are independent.

3.  Yes, I do think their tables do a good job of presenting the 
simulation results. However, I think if we can make some graph to
 show the patter would be better. 

4. The table only make sense in certain circumstance. Table 2
 demonstrate when n is smaller than 200. When D=1 or D= 2 the
 power is small. When D = 3, the power is higher than other 
situation and there is no strong evidence the power will depend
 on the mixing proportion. Table 4 shows when 1000 replications 
with mixing proportion pi =0.3 and 0.4.

5. I think the 10 times simulation is not enough, it will cause 
the error large.  However, when the number of simulation too large,
 then the cost will be too much. Therefore, I think 1000 simulation is 
a good tradeoff.
